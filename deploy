For the Academic Project:

Build the React Frontend (Manually):
Open a terminal and navigate to your frontend directory (where the package.json is located):
cd /path/to/your/academic-project/frontend
Run the React build command:
npm run build
This will create a production-ready build in the build/ folder. The contents of this folder (including index.html, JavaScript, CSS files, etc.) should be moved into the Spring Boot projectâ€™s static folder.
Copy the Build Files into the Spring Boot Project:
After running npm run build, copy the contents of the frontend/build folder into src/main/resources/static in your Spring Boot project.
cp -r /path/to/your/academic-project/frontend/build/* /path/to/your/academic-project/src/main/resources/static/
Build the Spring Boot Project:
Now, go to the root directory of your Spring Boot project (where pom.xml is located) and run the following command:
mvn clean install
This will clean, install, and build your Spring Boot application along with the static frontend files included.
Run the Application:
After the build is complete, run the following command to start your Spring Boot application:
java -jar target/academic-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
This will start the backend on localhost:8080, and React will handle the frontend.
